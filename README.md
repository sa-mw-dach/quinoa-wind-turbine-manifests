The refactored manifest repository using OpenShift GitOps with ApplicationSets and git file generator for parameters.

The main file here is the `wind-turbine-app.yaml` - file which contains an ApplicationSet using

## Used stuff

The applications can be installed manually via helm install as well. Change the values file according to your needs and install.

## Bugfixing:

#### PVC stuck - delete pvc

The pvcs are configured to be not deleted at helm uninstall. You should always delete them manually.

If some pvc gets stuck you can fix this via
```sh
oc patch pvc <pvc-name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers": []}}' --type=merge
```
